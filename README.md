## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash

## Challenges Faced
- **Responsive Design**: The original design file does not contains the responsive layout for either mobile or tablet. I have to modify the layouts on the go during the development.
- **Not So Perfect Images**: Images in the original design file is not so good for development, that needs to be handled manually.
